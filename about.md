A little about myself-- I am a data scientist working primarily on government contracts, where my projects have been focused on both machine learning for classification problems and unsupervised NLP. The motivation for this blog is essentially to create a space to share all of the research I've done for my own reference and for whoever else happens to stumble upon it.

I learned a lot of what I know from General Assembly's Data Science Immersive program which I attending in the spring of 2017. Prior to that, I worked in information services and did a lot of database work with some light web dev thrown in. Working with data at my first job, paired with my bachelors in math, piqued my interest in advanced analytics and data science in general. My main area of interest is research and development and my dream would be to work in life sciences and help with medical-related discoveries.
