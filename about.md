A little about myself... I'm currently a student at General Assembly's Data Science Immersive. We are constantly working on real-world applications of what we learn, and this is where I'll be sharing some of the insights I've discovered through the datasets we work with. I'll also be sharing anything I discover on the way--probably mostly revolving around whatever I spent a decent amount Googling.

### More Information

I have a puppy named Boomer and he is the coolest.
